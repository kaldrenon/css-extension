css-extension v(0.2)
====================

Making a chrome extension which will allow me to inject some CSS into pages

----

## Why?

I appreciate the reason that sites like http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq01.html and other online manual tools don't have any CSS on their pages, but for me it makes them very hard to read. I wanted a tool that would let me 
quickly slap a few attributes on the `body` tag so that I can make the page much more readable. I'm making it now.

## To Do

* ~~Syntax highlighting~~
* Linting
* Save snippets
* Optional "remember for next time" setting
* Optional domain-level CSS (set styles for a whole site, instead of per page)
