css-extension
=============

Making a chrome extension which will allow me to inject some CSS into pages

----

## Why?

I appreciate the reason that sites like http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq01.html and other online manual tools don't have any CSS on their pages, but for me it makes them very hard to read. I wanted a tool that would let me 
quickly slap a few attributes on the `body` tag so that I can make the page much more readable. I'm making it now.
