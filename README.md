# css-extension v0.2

A very simple extension made by a very simple guy.

## What?
A chrome extension which can inject CSS into pages. Adds a button to the URL bar. Click it, type some CSS, click apply.

Currently, it makes no effort to help you write CSS **well** or find the selectors you need to target. Features that help the user not do something stupid are forthcoming, but right now the tool requires the user to be careful.

## Why?

I appreciate the reason that sites like http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq01.html and other online manual tools don't have any CSS on their pages, but for me it makes them very hard to read. I wanted a tool that would let me quickly slap a few attributes on the `body` tag so that I can make the page much more readable. I'm making it now.

## To Do

* ~~Syntax highlighting~~
* ~~linting and error reporting~~
* Save snippets
* Optional "remember for next time" setting
* Optional domain-level CSS (set styles for a whole site, instead of per page)
* Selector finding
* Cooler name for extension
* Package and release (v1.0)
